whole time
(Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em)
What if I let your girl find
out?
(Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em)
What if she was to go tell mine?
(Tell 'em, tell 'em)
Cause I don't wanna live a
lie, lie, lie

I'mma play the backend for the
meantime
Took a break, had to focus on
some me time
We could keep it lowkey for the
meantime
Had a grip so tight from the
inside
Got you running back to back,
came three times
Now I'm kissing on your neck,
that's a sweet spot
But if we freaking, I need you
to say it
It only take one bitch to start
hating
(Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em,

whole time
(Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em)
What if I let your girl find
