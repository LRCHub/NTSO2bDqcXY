[00:07.21] Should tell my boyfriend, what I been doin'
[00:10.79] Been thinking of you, every time I screw him
[00:14.45] And if you want me, you gotta put the word in
[00:18.02] Go tell your girlfriend, that I'm your girlfriend
[00:42.52] 
[00:21.52] Originally, I wouldn't do it (oh, oh, oh, oh)
[00:24.94] But I can't have my heart looking stupid
[00:26.88] I gave niggas a shot and they blew it (blew it)
[00:29.04] Initially, I wouldn't do this
[00:30.38] Hennessy pourin' this shit getting fluid
[00:31.94] We were just friends, but then came in cupid (cupid)
[00:33.54] The tension was buildin', we had to pursue it
[00:56.04] 
[00:35.49] (Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em)
[00:37.29] What it's been with us this whole time
[00:38.85] (Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em)
[00:40.75] What if I let your girl find out?
[00:42.61] (Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em)
[00:44.13] What if she was to go tell mine?
[00:46.66] (Tell 'em, tell 'em)
[00:47.15] 'Cause I don't wanna live a lie, lie, lie
[01:07.65] 
[00:49.85] Should tell my boyfriend, what I been doin'
[00:53.30] Been thinking of you, every time I screw him
[00:56.86] And if you want me, you gotta put the word in
[01:00.50] Go tell your girlfriend, that I'm your girlfriend
[01:25.00] 
[01:04.09] I'ma play the backend for the meantime
[01:05.96] Took a break, had to focus on some me time
[01:07.78] We could keep it low-key for the meantime
[01:09.37] Had a grip so tight from the inside
[01:11.32] Got you running back to back, came three times
[01:13.02] Now I'm kissing on your neck, that's a sweet spot
[01:14.67] But if we freaking, I need you to say it
[01:16.56] It only take one bitch to start hating
[01:35.56] 
[01:18.14] (Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em)
[01:19.96] What it's been with us this whole time
[01:21.51] (Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em)
[01:23.46] What if I let your girl find out?
[01:25.28] (Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em)
[01:26.86] What if she was to go tell mine?
[01:29.25] (Tell 'em, tell 'em)
[01:30.03] 'Cause I don't wanna live a lie, lie, lie

[01:39.88] And if you want me, you gotta put the word in (uh-huh)
[01:43.34] Go tell your girlfriend, that I'm your girlfriend
[02:07.84] 
[01:46.79] Should tell my boyfriend, what I been doin' (maybe we should tell 'em)
